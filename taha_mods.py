# Modularity and Records Assignment
# rubiks cube collection
# Program: Modularity & Records
# Name: Taha Sarfraz
#   Date: Sunday May 15th, 2022
# Description: This program accepts, sorts, and visualizes collectable rubiks
# cubes. User is given an entry field where they can type enter to enter information
# about the cube. User can type search to search for a specific rubiks cube using an
# entered name. Program will then list the list holding the cube. User can type draw,
# and is prompted to enter dimensions of cube. Program will then open tkinter and draw
# a 2d version of said cube.
